title: About me
---

I'm a second-year PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at Stony
Brook University. 

## Previous work

I was an undergrad at [Grinnell College](http://www.grinnell.edu/), Iowa, where
I majored in Mathematics and Computer science. I worked on varied research
topics in college, such as
* CT reconstruction problems in medical imaging
* "rainbow" analogues to classical theorems in Ramsey theory
* natural language processing models for a technology startup.

## Research interests

I'm interested in the intersection of mathematical analysis and optimization
and control. I like to stay right on the boundary between pure and applied
math, and I enjoy working on simulation and other software projects. 

My "hobby" interests are primarily in economics, where I enjoy studying the
models of theoretical macroeconomics and monetary policy. I also like to study
math outside of my research interests, such as algebra, just to keep on my toes!

## Other stuff

I am a big fan of *The Simpsons* and have strong opinions about the show's run.
I enjoy collecting [strange

[Frinkiac](https://frinkiac.com/) site. 

I'm also a proud fake-news reading, [mr bernke](http://i.imgur.com/ItWuCed.png) thanking, populist baiting, podcast listening, $oro$-bux earning
[neoliberal](https://i.redd.it/3h4jgsvgh6jy.png) shill.
