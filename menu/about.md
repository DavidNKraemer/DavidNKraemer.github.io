title: About me
---

I am a sixth-year PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at [Stony
Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ams/). My thesis advisor is
Distinguished Professor [Eugene
Feinberg](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~feinberg/public/). 


## Research interests

I'm interested in the intersection of mathematical analysis and optimization
and control. My main research interests involve parametric optimization
problems and their applications to Markov decision processes, such as models of
inventory control. I like to stay right on the boundary between pure and applied
math, and I enjoy working on simulation and other software projects.

My "hobby" interests are primarily in reinforcement learning, where I enjoy
tinkering with different RL algorithms and environments. I also like to study
math outside of my research interests, such as algebra, just to keep on my
toes!  

## Previous work

I was an undergrad at [Grinnell College](http://www.grinnell.edu/), Iowa, where
I majored in Mathematics and Computer science. I worked on varied research
topics in college, such as
* CT reconstruction problems in medical imaging
* "rainbow" analogues to classical theorems in Ramsey theory
* natural language processing models for a technology startup.


## Other stuff

I am a big fan of *The Simpsons* and have strong opinions about the show's run.
I enjoy collecting [strange
