title: Books that changed my mind
---

I am starting a project to compile a collection of books whose arguments
influenced my beliefs and document exactly how each one did so. I find that we
change our minds quite frequently during our lives, but we often aren't willing
-- or able -- to admit it when we do. That is partly because, as a rule, these
shifts occur, not as foundation-shaking quakes, but as small tremors in our
beliefs. Yet I strongly believe we should distinguish gradual, continuous
evolution of beliefs with rigid consistency in them.

I expect this will be a difficult but useful exercise, and I hope to discover
the motivations, contours, and major shifts of my own beliefs in the process.

## The list

  Prosperity, and Poverty* (2013). [read](books/why-nations-fail)

  How to Fix It* (2012).
