---

## Prior to reading

* Lazy Jared Diamond understanding of geographic determinism.
* Solow model = capital capital capital
* General ignorance due to Eurocentrism

## The book

* Institutions matter
* Inclusive vs. extractive
* Political institutions: shared participation in political processes, legitimacy,
  etc. protection of minority constituencies.
* Economic institutions: equal application of just laws, shared participation in
  markets, property rights, etc.
* *Exhaustive* survey of different case studies

## After reading

* **Institutions matter**
* Enough counterexamples exist to dispel alternative hypotheses, including the
  crass racial difference ones advocated by many.
* Which American institutions are inclusive? Which are extractive?
