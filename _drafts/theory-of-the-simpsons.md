Much ink has been spilled about how to process the 29-season run of *The
Simpsons*.  The venerable television series has a dedicated but splintered
fandom, especially with respect to its evolution (or decline) in the latter
decades of the show.  Of particular concern is the show's willingness to rewrite
its own history, the so-called "ret-con"problem.  Modifications to the timeline
of Homer and Marge's marriage and similarly of Bart's birth have produced
considerable criticism, and the ret-conning appears frequently elsewhere in the
show's extended world.

There are practical defenses of ret-conning. The strongest in my opinion follows
like this. *The Simpsons* is, at its core, satire. As a societal critique, its
content and style follow the evolving cultural mores. And since the culture of
2018 diverges significantly from that of 1989 (I assume&mdash;full disclosure:
I wasn't alive then), satire has no choice but to recalibrate to succeed.

(This is of course orthogonal to whether *The Simpsons*' satire, on its own
merits, succeeds in 2018 *at all*. That deserves a separate post entirely.)


The show's producers and writers typically produce the standard, but important,
response to the hand wringing: after three decades, *any* excursion into the
universe's past is bound to trample on existing canon. Any dedicated fan will
know that the show itself deals with canon problems early in its run. *The
Simpsons* warns us early and often not to take it so seriously.

Nonetheless, it's the job of any fan to disregard this advice, and as one
myself, I will do so accordingly. To deal with continuity, I am going to step
outside the standard canon fights that many fandoms engage with and offer a
different theory entirely: *The Simpsons* as Midrash.

## Midrash in the Jewish tradition

The foundational texts of Jewish literature begin, of course, with the Hebrew
Bible. The Torah, the first of the three major sections of the Hebrew Bible,
contains a rich tapestry of figures, narratives, and laws; yet the text is also
filled with obscurity, contradiction, and the simply bizarre. In reconciling
these realities with the claim by Judaism that the Torah is Divinely written and
ordained, the tradition was compelled to explore non-literal interpretation.
Indeed, the [four "levels"][PaRDeS] of classical interpretation&mdash;*p'shat*,
*remez*, *d'rash*, and *sod*&mdash;are designed to address these complexities.
Whereas *p'shat* seeks to identify the plain (sometimes literal) meaning of the
text, the other levels work to draw out deeper insights inspired by the text. In
particular, *d'rash* starts with a question about a passage and explores, using
received methods of hermeneutics, its connections to the Jewish tradition's
moral and religious teachings.

Typically, Midrash on the Hebrew Bible present supplementary narratives or
identify hidden connections between passages. The Midrashic approach is to
examine curious language or apparent contradictions, sometimes resolving them
and sometimes expanding them. The literal historicity of a Midrashic insertion,
however, is of secondary concern. Sometimes, we require the Midrash to be
interpreted literally, but in many other situations, the insight is not in
providing essential narrative details but in elucidating personalities or
expressing ideas tied to the passage. And the collections of Midrashic
commentaries can contradict themselves, usually as a product of differing
threads of the intellectual tradition.

The obvious peril with using Midrashic exegesis is that it becomes difficult to
separate valid *d'rash* from phony *d'rash*. This requires considerable work,
but as a general heuristic, the core idea of the *d'rash* cannot contradict the
simple *p'shat* understanding.

### A very ancient donkey

Let's consider a famous example of Midrashic exegesis. (Note: I am translating
the following texts, and all errors are mine.) Consider ([Ex. 4:20][Ex 4:20]):

> Moses took his wife and sons, mounted them **on the donkey**,
> and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took G-d's staff in his hand.

The verse is curiously identifying a specific donkey with the definite article.
Now, the *p'shat* of the verse is uncomplicated: Moses and his family saddled a
donkey and left for Egypt. Why does it say "the donkey" then? It's not obvious
but, for the plain meaning at least, not critical. 

The reader sensitive to *d'rash* is left unsatisfied, because she suspects
a deeper reason for the definite article. And, indeed, we find the Medieval
commentator [Rashi][Rashi wiki] reaching for a Midrashic source, writing:

> **on the donkey**. A *specific* donkey: the one on which [Abraham
> saddled][Gen.  22:3] to bind Isaac, and the one on which the Messiah will
> ride out of exile, as [it is said][Zech. 9:9]: "[the Messiah is] poor and
> riding on a donkey".

That donkey would have to be over 3,000 years old by the tradition's estimate.
Obviously, normal donkeys don't live to be thousands of years old.  So why does
the *d'rash* take a subtle grammatical quirk and give a (seemingly) totally
absurd explanation? 

One answer is that the *d'rash* interpretation uses literal language to express
abstract connections. Need it *really* be the same donkey? Of course not. Is the
fact that Abraham, Moses, and the Messiah ride donkeys to begin their Divine
missions the essential insight? Absolutely. Here I'm not interested in the full
reconciliation of these three distinct verses through the *d'rash*, but I want
to underscore this point: Midrash operates in literal language but without
binding itself to literal consequences.


## *The Simpsons* as Midrash

Midrash provides a framework for interpreting the lengthy run of *The Simpsons*,
but it requires a major additional claim: that there exists a subset of the
show's episodes which form the "Bible" of the universe. The rest of the series,
then, would form the canon's "Midrash". For the sake of argument, let's assume
that the first eight seasons form the show's essential canon. (Why stop before
nine?  Let [Armand Tamzarian](/files/simpsons/gifs/tamzarian-imposter.gif) tell
you.)

Now, take a controversial bit of ret-conning: ["That '90s Show"][sadgasm]
(S19E11), in which we learn that Homer starts a Grunge band to support Marge as
she completes a degree at Springfield University. This upends three distinct
components of the show's established canon. First,
